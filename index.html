            Welcome to my joke website created for my final project for APSU's CSCI 4018 Cloud Computing class. I hope that you will enjoy the absolute
            stupid joked that I will be implementing into this website as I am not a very comedic individual. I definitely stole these jokes from Reddit.
            This line is here to show the example of me commiting and pushing a change to GitHub to show in my EC2 instance.
